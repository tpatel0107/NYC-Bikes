# NYC-Bikes
# Overview of the stastical analysis:
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:
Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

# Explanation of results: 
![GitHub Graph](https://github.com/tpatel0107/NYC-Bikes/blob/main/Check%20out%20times%20for%20users.PNG?raw=true)
Trip durations went down significantly as the hours went by, there was a peak and then a significant drop.

Highest number of riders were men, women scored second highest and there were a small amout of unkowns.

Count of bike riders were highest between the hours of 6am and 9am and then again in the evening hours between 4pm and 8pm.

There were significantly higher male riders during the morning and evening hours in comparison to women or unkown.

There were more subscribers than customers (male riders) during the week. 
# Summary:
More subscibers are using bike sharing program, there is significant percentage of male riders using the program consistently during the weekdays and weekends who are subscribers.
I would provide two other visualizations which would be, Trips by Gender weekday by hour-with value and Most popular start and stop locations. This is important for investors to know when considering how many bikes to have avaliable and where to have the most bikes available to meet rider's demands. Also the time of the day and the gender that is most likely to utilize ride sharing.
